# Changelog

The newest version is at the top, and its heading is where Emplio's version number lives. "What's new" is shown to people in the app, so keep it in everyday words. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#releasing-a-new-version).

## 1.0.0 (2026-11-09)

### What's new

- See what's changed any time, from What's new in your account menu.
- Emplio tells you when a new version is ready, and one tap brings your screen up to date.
- Replies are shorter: a line or two, unless you ask for more.

### For developers

- `CHANGELOG.md` is the one place versions live. `GET /health` reports the running version and `GET /changelog` the "What's new" lines.
- The app compares the version it first saw with the server's on reconnect, on focus and every 5 minutes, and offers a reload when they differ.
- Each new version on `main` publishes a GitHub release and version-tagged Docker images.
- Tightened the default reply length in the system prompt (#2).
